#+title: SQLite

An embeddable C database that provides an SQL interface.

A.k.a. The database that runs the world.

* Quality Management

The SQLite teams seems to have developed a solid culture on how to produce quality software. They have published a document that describes their Quality Managment: [[https://www.sqlite.org/qmplan.html][Quality Management (at sqlite.org)]]. It is inspired by [[id:53cd2581-e688-492c-bcbc-830909fbe009][DO-178C]].
