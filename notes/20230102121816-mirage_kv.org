Provides type signatures for a simple key-value store:

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
  val get : t -> key -> (string, error) Stdlib.result Lwt.t
  val set : t -> key -> string -> (unit, write_error) Stdlib.result Lwt.t
#+END_SRC

The type signature is implemented by various implementations such as ~mirage-kv-mem~ (in-memory) or ~mirage-kv-unix~ (persisted to Unix file system) or [[id:c2004eb8-da9c-436a-b37d-034b8f87be51][git-kv]].

The interface does not provide a way of doing range queries, it does not seem usable for evaluating complex queries.
