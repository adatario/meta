#+title: Sandmark

Tools and instrumentation to run OCaml benchmarks (see also [[id:85012293-8110-4c1c-8f35-4a58a9b5e312][Benchmarking]]).

The project itself seems to be about dealing with the complexities of running various variants of software (with various compilers) and visualizing results. It's not primarily a OCaml tool or library.
